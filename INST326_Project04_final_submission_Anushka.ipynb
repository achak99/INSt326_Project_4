    "I added a search functionality that allows users to find notes by titles or tags. This feature introduces a search bar where users can enter keywords, which the program then uses to filter notes. The search is performed by iterating through the notebook list and selecting notes where the entered keyword matches elements in either the title or tags of the notes. The matching notes are then displayed in the main window. This enhancement significantly improves user experience by providing an efficient way to navigate through large collections of notes, making it easier to find specific information quickly. This feature leverages the encapsulation principle of object-oriented programming. The search logic is encapsulated within its method, keeping it separate from other functionalities, which simplifies maintenance and scalability of the code."

    "The program now supports saving and reading notebooks in multiple formats: TXT, JSON, CSV, and XML. Users can choose the format when saving or opening notebooks via a file dialog that filters files by type. This flexibility allows the application to be used in various contexts, such as data sharing or processing with other systems that might require specific formats. Each format is handled with appropriate libraries or methods to parse or format the data correctly. This improvement makes the program more versatile and useful in diverse environments, accommodating different user needs or external system requirements. This functionality utilizes polymorphism, where the save_notebook and open_notebook methods can operate differently depending on the file format chosen by the user. It also demonstrates abstraction by hiding the complexity of format-specific operations from the user, offering a simple interface to save and load data."

This feature is particularly useful for users who store code or commands in their notes for later use in programming tasks. This enhancement streamlines the workflow for users who frequently transition between note-taking and coding, facilitating a more efficient and seamless user experience. This feature demonstrates the use of inheritance and encapsulation. The method handling the clipboard operations is encapsulated within its function, ensuring that the logic for manipulating the clipboard is managed in one place and can be easily maintained or modified without affecting other parts of the program."
